# GitLab Metrics Dashboard

This app will be used to show significant metrics on how a team is performing during their software release schedule. GitLab is a web application that is used as a software development lifecycle and version control tool. It allows software teams to store code, write documentation and track issues in a continuous integration environment. This application would be written in Python utilizing Flask as the web framework and PyCharts for data visualization.
